# C-Practice

<h1>A repository containing practice problems and projects written in the C language</h1>

<hr>

<p>This repository contains solved problems and projects I have built over this year.</p>
<p>The idea of this repo is to keep all of the work I have done with the C language and serve as a progess tracker of how well I have learnt the language for a year.</p>
